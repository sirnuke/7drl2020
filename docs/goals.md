# Goals

* Length of game corresponds to success.
* Give player choices in responding to random events.
* Enemies become progressively harder, but so do player abilities and minions.
* Players can play it safe, but risk falling behind.
* Rogue AI should be sophisticated enough to avoid super obvious cheesing.
